* Quick Intro / commericial break

- HelloGold is platform to allow the average Malaysian to buy, store and sell investment grade gold at close to international spot prices as a means of diversifying their savings portfolio.
- Founded by former CFO of World Gold Council
- CTO is former VP of Bangkok Bank 
- Partnering with AEON Credit
- Fully allocated gold vaulted in fully insured vault in Singapore



* Personal philosophy w.r.t. blockchain

* What I AM going to cover
- What is a blockchain?
- What is special about Ethereum?
- Programming smart contracts
- some tools to help you get started
- talking to contracts from a wallet
- arbitary subjective comments about random things...

* And then the good bit
- T.C. Wu will explain how you can talk to it with Ruby :-)

Which then will give you a new tool for problem solving

* What is a blockchain
- signed transactions
- Put into signed blocks
- Which are added to a chain
- in a manner such that all the independant nodes that operate the network
- agreed the whole thing to be valid (consensus)

* Digital Signatures
- I am going to assume that you understand hashing
- hash "Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them."
- change the comma after "Young man" to a full stop & rehash
- a small change in the content causes a huge change in the result.
.play hashBaby.go  /start main OMIT/,/end main OMIT/
- now encrypt the hash value using public key encryption....

* Public Key encryption in 20 seconds
- uses a private key (it's mathematical)
- public key derived from private key (but not vice versa)
- address is derived from public key
- something encrypted by private key can be read with public key
- with public key you can prove it was encrypted by owner of private key.
- encrypting the hash, ensures that the hash, thus the document is unchanged
- and ensures that the signer is who they say they are.

* Consensus
- design of consensus algorithm ensures that no one node makes all the decisions
- makes it virtually impossible for anybody to modify the past records in the chain

So what are all these transactions doing?

Web analogy:

.code demo_code.txt /start REST OMIT/,/end REST OMIT/

We are all used to ACCOUNTING transactions that transfer value.

Enter BITCOIN and 1000 other AltCoins

Mathematics and computer science guarantee ownership and scarcity.

* So what is Ethereum doing differently?
- The nodes are not just accounting machines
- A transaction does not JUST have to transfer value
- A transaction can *POST* a _contract_ to the chain
- Just like you *could* post a script and have it delivered to a script folder on a server
- Ethereum becomes a distributed computer
- code is compiled into byte code
- byte code is placed on the blockchain
- every node has a Virtual Machine (byte code interpreter)
- users of the contract need to know the available entry points

* What is a contract?
- is just like a ruby app in that it has
-- instance data
-- methods with parameters and local data
-- constructors
-- it can hold value (ETH)
-- it can send and receive ETH
-- code it is executed by *every* node to get consensus

Consensus is the agreement on the transactions. 

The effect is that the internal state of each node will be the same.

* Two ways to interact
- *Transactions*
make changes to the storage (and cost Ether)
can only return results by _events_

(caveat - one contract can transact on another *and* get returned data)

If a transaction fails *ALL* changes are reversed and *NO* logs produced.

- *Calls*		
query the state of the storage or the results of a calculation
get an immediate response
cannot change the state of the storage

* Building A Coin Contract

.code demo_code.txt  /start skeleton OMIT/,/end skeleton OMIT/

kinda familar - let's see the core data structure

.code RubyTokenPresent.sol  /start fa OMIT/,/end fa OMIT/

* Essential for ERC20 coin

.code RubyTokenPresent.sol  /start basic OMIT/,/end basic OMIT/

.code RubyTokenPresent.sol  /start balance OMIT/,/end balance OMIT/

.code RubyTokenPresent.sol  /start xfer OMIT/,/end xfer OMIT/

* Modifiers & events

.code RubyTokenPresent.sol  /start mod event OMIT/,/end mod event OMIT/

Events put data into the log (along with the recorded transaction) and can be detected by event handlers in wallets etc.

Modifiers are an easy way to add a prefix to a function for code reuse.

"throw" causes the transaction to be terminated and changes rolled back.

* The SPECIAL RubyCoin functions

.code RubyTokenPresent.sol  /start cs OMIT/,/end cs OMIT/
